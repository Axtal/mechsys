MechSys - Open Programming Library for Mechanical Systems

MechSys is a programming library for the implementation of simulation 
tools in mechanics. Its source code is mainly written in C++ with easy
to use templates for further custumization.

Potential applications include, for instance, solid mechanics 
and the dynamics of granular materials using the discrete element method, 
and both computational fluid dynamics and computational electromagnetics 
using the lattice Boltzmann method.
